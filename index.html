	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> My name is Michael Sanchez. I grew up playing guitar and sports. After working for a number of years in the Music Industry I am ready to expand my skills and try something new. I hope that I can keep up with the class and be able to offer something of educational value to my cohorts. I have had the opportunitly as a musician to play in front of large crowds. As a touring front of house engineer and studio engineer I've worked with some fun and interesting people </p>
